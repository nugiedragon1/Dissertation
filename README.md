# Second-Hand Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
The second-hand car market has been an interesting topic for the past year with an increase in sales. Although there has been some research in the past with different approaches and complexity, this dissertation topic is about how the approaches of two different models can be used to predict the price of the second-hand car market. The support vector machine (SVR) and the linear regression have been implemented for this project and compared in terms of scoring metrics which are the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the mean absolute error (MAE). The result of both models has their own advantage and disadvantage to give insights into the second-hand car market.
